# SharkIO

SharkIO is a Web Application which allows users to subscribe and manage their subscription to a generic digital service (in this case a google chrome extension).

To access the service users have to login with their Discord Account. Once logged in, they can subscribe to the service by paying with their credit card.
The payment flow has been implemented by using Stripe's technologies. In this case, the subscription is composed by an initial setup fee, plus a recurrent monthly payment.
Once that users are subscribed to the service, they can access their personal dashboard, through which thay can retrive all the information related to their subscription, or perform some actions such as:
- Manage their subscription.
- Joining the Official Discord's Server of the Service.
- Unbind their license from their current Discord Account.
- Reset the IP address on which the software is binded (in this case google chrome's extension).
